need a way to create, edit, and delete users
method for long-term storage will be text file (can worry about encryption later)

option 1:
    create a user class
    class will have all the necessary member functions, 
        and have required data (i.e. user, pass, privileges)

option 2:
    use a set of functions in the main program, like a pseudo-class
    

the true class seems like a more effective solution, but im not sure how to initialize the object in the actual program
like, once a user object is declared, 

idea: 
have user file with list of all users
user class member function parses for specific user
load password into string
prompt user for password
user class member function compares string to input and returns true on accepted
potentially global variable for logged in (not sure how to do this, definitely a better way)
can use logged in (whatever way) to check for other options

maybe terminal command can be login, (login derri) 
then prompt for password
which instantiates user object with parameter, (User signIn(derri))
which parses file for said user name (derri)
if user found in file  
    compare passwords
else
    error message of incorrect user or pass

im starting to think that a class may not be very useful here, and instead should just use a global var for privileges
maybe a struct?
